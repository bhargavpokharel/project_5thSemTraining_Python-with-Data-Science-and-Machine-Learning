# Titanic Survival Prediction Project - Step-by-Step Plan

## Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning

- Load the train and test datasets.  
- Inspect the data for missing values and inconsistent data.  
- Drop columns with too many missing values or irrelevant information (e.g., `Cabin`, `Ticket`, `Name`).  
- Fill missing values for columns like `Age` and `Embarked` with appropriate statistics (median, mode).  

## Step 2: Feature Selection and Preparation

- Select meaningful features for the model (e.g., `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`).  
- Separate features (`X`) and target variable (`y = Survived`).  
- Convert categorical variables (like `Sex` and `Embarked`) into numeric form using encoding techniques.  

## Step 3: Data Splitting and Scaling

- Split the training data into training and validation sets.  
- Scale numerical features to improve model performance.  

## Step 4: Model Selection and Training

- Train classification models such as Random Forest.  
- Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.  

## Step 5: Predict on Test Data

- Apply the selected model on the test dataset.  
- Prepare predictions in the required format for submission or analysis.  

## Step 6: Visualization and Insights

- Visualize feature importance and survival patterns.  
- Summarize key insights from the data and model results.
